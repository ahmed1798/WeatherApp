- **Data Layer**: Contains RepositoryImplementation and Network. 
- **Presentation Layer**: Contains view models and views.

## Unit Testing

The project includes unit tests to ensure the functionality of the network layer and view models:

1. Open the Test navigator in Xcode (âŒ˜ + 6).
2. Run the tests by pressing the play button next to the test suite or individual tests.

### Unit Tests

- **ViewModel Tests**: Tests for `MWeatherViewModel` to ensure it correctly fetches and processes data.
- **Repository Tests**: Tests for `WeatherUseCase` to ensure it correctly interacts with the data source.
